The bus1 Kernel Message Bus defines and implements a distributed object model.
It allows local processes to send messages to objects owned by remote processes,
as well as share their own objects with others. Object ownership is static and
cannot be transferred. Access to remote objects is prohibited, unless it was
explicitly granted. Processes can transmit messages to a remote object via the
message bus, transferring a data payload, object access rights, file
descriptors, or other auxiliary data.
    </p><p>
To participate on the message bus, a peer context must be created. Peer contexts
are kernel objects, identified by a file descriptor. They are not bound to any
process, but can be shared freely. The peer context provides a message queue to
store all incoming messages, a registry for all locally owned objects, and
tracks access rights to remote objects. A peer context never serves as
routing entity, but merely as anchor for peer-owned resources. Any message on
the bus is always destined for an object, and the bus takes care to transfer a
message into the message queue of the peer context that owns this object.
    </p><p>
The message bus manages object access using capabilities. That is, by default
only the owner of an object is granted access rights. No other peer can access
the object, nor are they aware of the existance of the object. However, access
rights can be transmitted as auxiliary data with any message, effectively
granting them to the receiver of the message. This even works transitively, that
is, any peer that was granted access to an object can pass on those rights, even
if they do not own the object. But mind that no access rights can ever be
revoked, besides the owner destroying the object.
    </p><div class="refsect2"><a name="id-1.5.5"></a><h3>Nodes and Handles</h3><p>
Each peer context comes with a registry of owned objects, which in bus1
parlance are called <span class="emphasis"><em>nodes</em></span>. A peer is always the exclusive
owner of all nodes it has created. Ownership cannot be transferred. The message
bus manages access rights to nodes as a set of <span class="emphasis"><em>handles</em></span> held
by each peer. For each node a peer has access to, whether it is local or remote,
the message bus keeps a handle on the peer. Initially when a node is created the
node owner is the only peer with a handle to the newly created node. Handles are
local to each peer, but can be transmitted as auxiliary data with any message,
effectively allocating a new handle to the same node in the destination peer.
This works transitively, and each peer that holds a handle can pass it on
further, or deliberately drop it. As long as a peer has a handle to a node it
can send messages to it. However, a node owner can, at any time, decide to
destroy a node. This causes all further message transactions to this node to
fail, although messages that have already been queued for the node are still
delivered. When a node is destroyed, all peers that hold handles to the node are
notified of the destruction. Moreover, if the owner of a node that has been
destroyed releases all its handles to the node, no further messages or
notifications destined for the node are delivered.
      </p><p>
Handles are the only way to refer to both local and remote nodes. For each
handle allocated on a peer, a 64-bit ID is assigned to identify that particular
handle on that particular peer. The ID is only valid locally on that peer, it
cannot be used by remote peers to address the handle (in other words, the ID
namespace is tied to each peer and does not define global entities). When
creating a new node, userspace freely selects the ID except that the
<code class="constant">BUS1_HANDLE_FLAG_MANAGED</code> bit must be cleared, and when
receiving a handle from a remote peer the kernel assigns the ID, which always
has the <code class="constant">BUS1_HANDLE_FLAG_MANAGED</code> set. Additionally, the
<code class="constant">BUS1_HANDLE_FLAG_REMOTE</code> flag tells whether a specific ID
refers to a remote handle (if set), or to an owner handle (if unset). An ID
assigned by the
kernel is never reused, even after a handle has been dropped. The kernel keeps a
user-reference count for each handle. Every time a handle is exposed to a peer,
the user-reference count of that handle is incremented by one. This is never
done asynchronously, but only synchronously when an ioctl is called by the
holding peer. Therefore, a peer can reliable deduce the current user-reference
count of all its handles, regardless of any ongoing message transaction.
References can be explicitly dropped by a peer. Once the counter of a handle
hits zero, it is destroyed, its ID becomes invalid, and if it was assigned by
the kernel, it will not be reused again. Note that a peer can never have
multiple different handles to the same node, rather the kernel always coalesces
them into a single handle, using the user-reference counter to track it.
However, if a handle is fully released, but the peer later acquires a handle to
the same remote node again, its ID will be different, as IDs are never reused.
      </p><p>
New nodes are allocated on-demand by passing the desired ID to the kernel in any
ioctl that accepts a handle ID. When allocating a new node, the node owner
implicitly also gets a handle to that node. As long as the node is valid, the
kernel will pin a single user-reference to the owner's handle. This guarantees
that a node owner always retains access to their node, until they explicitly
destroy it (which will make it possible for userspace to release the handle like
any other). Once all the handles to a local node have been released, no more
messages destined for the node will be received. Otherwise, a handle to a local
node behaves just like any other handle, that is, user-references are acquired
and released according to its use. However, whenever the overall sum of all
user-references on all handles to a node drops to one (which implies that only
the pinned reference of the owner is left), a release-notification is queued on
the node owner. If the counter is incremented again, any such notification is
dropped, if not already dequeued.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2"><a name="id-1.5.6"></a><h3>Message Transactions</h3><p>
A message transaction atomically transfers a message to any number of
destinations. Unless requested otherwise, the message transaction fully succeeds
or fully fails.
      </p><p>
To receive message payloads, each peer has an associated shmem-backed
<span class="emphasis"><em>pool</em></span> which may be mapped read-only by the receiving peer.
The kernel copies the message payload directly from the sending peer to each of
the receivers' pool without an intermediary kernel buffer. The pool is divided
into <span class="emphasis"><em>slices</em></span> to hold each message. When a message is
received, its <span class="emphasis"><em>offset</em></span> into the pool in bytes is returned to
userspace, and userspace has to explicitly release the slice once it has
finished with it.
      </p><p>
The kernel amends all data messages with the <code class="varname">uid</code>,
<code class="varname">gid</code>, <code class="varname">pid</code>, <code class="varname">tid</code>, and
optionally the security context of the sending peer. The information is
collected from the sending peer when the message is sent and translated into the
namespaces of the receiving peer's file-descriptor.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2"><a name="id-1.5.7"></a><h3>Seed Message</h3><p>
Every peer may pin a special <span class="emphasis"><em>seed</em></span> message. Only the peer
itself may set and retrieve the seed, and at most one seed message may be pinned
at any given time. The seed typically describes the peer itself and pins any
nodes and handles necessary to bootstrap the peer.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2"><a name="id-1.5.8"></a><h3>Resource quotas</h3><p>
Each user has a fixed amount of available resources. The limits are static, but
may be overridden by module parameters. Limits are placed on the amount of
memory a user's pools may consume, the number of handles a user may hold and,
the number of inflight messages may be destined for a user and the number of
file descriptors may be inflight to a user. All inflight resources are accounted
on the receiving peer.
      </p><p>
As resources are accounted on the receiver, a quota mechanism is in place in
order to avoid intentional or unintentional resource exhaustion by a malicious
or broken sending user. At the time of a message transaction, the sending user
may consume in total (including what is consumed by previous transactions) half
of the total resources of the receiving user that have not been consumed by
another user. When a message is dequeued its resource consumption is deaccounted
from the sending users quota.
      </p><p>
If a receiving peer does not dequeue any of its incoming messages it would be
possible for a users quota to be fully consumed by one peer, making it
impossible to communicate with other functioning peers owned by the same user. A
second quota is therefore enforced per-peer, enforcing that at the time of a
message transaction the receiving peer may consume at in total (including what
is consumed by previous transactions) half of the total resources available to
the sending user that have not been consumed by another peer.
      </p></div><div class="refsect2"><a name="id-1.5.9"></a><h3>Global Ordering</h3><p>
Despite there being no global synchronization, all events on the bus, such as
sending or receiving of messages, release of handles or destruction of nodes,
behave as if they were globally ordered. That is, for any two events it is
always possible to consider one to have happened before the other in such a way
that it is consistent with all the effects observed on the bus.
      </p><p>
For instance, if two events occurr on one peer (say the sending of a message,
and the destruction of a node), and they are observed on another peer (by
receiving the message and receiving a destruction notification for the node), we
are guaranteed that the order the events occurred in and the order they were
observed in is the same.
      </p><p>
One could consider a further example involving three peers, if a message is sent
from one peer to two others, and after receiving the message the first recipient
sends a further message to the second recipient, it is guaranteed that the
original message is received before the subsequent one.
      </p><p>
This principle of causality is also respected in the pressence of side-channel
communication. That is, if one event may have triggered another, even if on
different, disconnected, peers, we are guaranteed that the events are ordered
accordingly. To be precise, if one event (such as receiving a message) completed
before another (such as sending a message) was started, then they are ordered
accordingly.
      </p><p>
Also in the case where there can be no causal relationship, we are guaranteed a
global order. In case two events happend concurrently, there can never be any
inconsistency in which occurred before the other. By way of example, consider
two peers sending one message each to two different peers, we are guaranteed
that both the recipient peers receive the two messages in the same order, even
though the order may be arbitrary.

<code class="constant">BUS1_MSG_DATA</code> indicates a regular message sent from another
peer, possibly containing a payload, as well as attached handles and
filedescriptors. <code class="constant">BUS1_MSG_NODE_DESTROY</code> indicates that the
node referenced by the handle in <code class="varname">msg.destination</code> was
destroyed by its owner. <code class="constant">BUS1_MSG_NODE_RELEASE</code> indicates
that all the references to handles referencing the node in
<code class="varname">msg.destination</code> have been released.
                  </p><p>
<code class="varname">msg.flags</code> indicates additional flags of the message.
<code class="constant">BUS1_MSG_FLAG_HAS_SECCTX</code> indicates that a security context
was attached to the message (to distinguish an empty <code class="varname">n_secctx</code>
from an invalid one).
<code class="constant">BUS1_MSG_FLAG_CONTINUE</code> indicates that there are more
messages queued which belong to the same message transaction.
                  </p><p>
<code class="varname">msg.destination</code> is the ID of the destination node or handle
of the message.
                  </p><p>
<code class="varname">msg.uid</code>, <code class="varname">msg.gid</code>,
<code class="varname">msg.pid</code>, and <code class="varname">msg.tid</code> are the user, group,
process and thread ID of the process that created the sending peer context.
                  </p><p>
<code class="varname">msg.offset</code> is the offset, in bytes, into the pool of the
payload and <code class="varname">msg.n_bytes</code> is its length.
                  </p><p>
<code class="varname">msg.n_handles</code> is the number of handles attached to the
message. The handle IDs are stored in the pool following the payload (and
possibly padding to make the array 8-byte aligned).
                  </p><p>
<code class="varname">msg.n_fds</code> is the number of handles attached to the
message, or 0 if <code class="constant">BUS1_RECV_FLAG_INSTALL_FDS</code> was not set.
The file descriptor numbers are stored in the pool following the handle array
(and possibly padding to make the array 8-byte aligned).
                  </p><p>
<code class="varname">msg.n_secctx</code> is the number of bytes attached to the message,
which contain the security context of the sender. The security context is
stored in the pool following the payload (and possibly padding to make it
8-byte aligned).

A call to
<a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/close"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">close</span>(2)</span></a>
releases the passed file descriptor. When all file descriptors associated with
the same peer context have been closed, the peer is shut down. This destroys all
nodes of that peer, releases all handles, flushes its queue and pool, and
deallocates all related resources. Messages that have been sent by the peer and
are still queued on destination queues are unaffected by this.
