The Bus1 Kernel Message Bus defines and implements a distributed object model.
It allows local processes to send messages to objects owned by remote processes,
as well as share their own objects with others. Object ownership is static and
cannot be transferred. Access to remote objects is prohibited, unless it was
explicitly granted. Processes can transmit messages to a remote object via the
message bus, transferring a data payload, object access rights, file
descriptors, or other auxiliary data.
    </p><p>
To participate on the message bus, a peer context must be created. Peer contexts
are kernel objects, identified by a file descriptor. They are not bound to any
process, but can be shared freely. The peer context provides a message queue to
store all incoming messages, a registry for all locally owned objects, and
tracks access rights to remote objects. A peer context never serves as
routing entity, but merely as anchor for peer-owned resources. Any message on
the bus is always destined at an object, and the bus takes care to transfer a
message into the message queue of the peer context that owns this object.
    </p><p>
The message bus manages object access using capability-based security. That is,
by default only the owner of an object is granted access rights. No other peer
can access the object, nor are they aware of the existance of the object.
However, access rights can be transmitted as auxiliary data with any message,
effectively granting them to the receiver of the message. This even works
transitively, that is, any peer that was granted access to an object can pass on
those rights, even if they do not own the object. But mind that no access rights
can ever be revoked, besides the owner destroying the object.
    </p><div class="refsect2"><a name="id-1.5.5"></a><h3>Nodes and Handles</h3><p>
Each peer context comes with a registry of owned objects, which in bus1
parlance are called <span class="emphasis"><em>nodes</em></span>. A peer is always the exclusive
owner of all nodes it has created. Ownership cannot be transferred. Furthermore, 
initially, the node owner is the only peer with access to a newly created node.
The message bus manages access rights to nodes as a set of
<span class="emphasis"><em>handles</em></span> held by each peer. For each node a peer has access
to, whether it is local or remote, the message bus keeps a handle on the peer.
Those handles are local to each peer, but can be transmitted as auxiliary data
with any message, effectively allocating a new handle to the same node in the
destination peer. This works transitively, and each peer with access rights can
pass them on further, or deliberately drop them again. As long as a peer has
access rights to a node it can send messages to it. However, a node owner can,
at any time, decide to destroy a node. This causes all further message
transactions to this node to fail, and all peers holding access rights to the
node (i.e., they own a handle for that node) are notified of the destruction.
      </p><p>
Handles are the only way to refer to both local and remote nodes. For each
handle allocated on a peer, a 64bit ID is assigned to identify that particular
handle on that particular peer. The ID is only valid locally on that peer. It
cannot be used by remote peers to address the handle (in other words, the ID
namespace is tied to each peer and does not define global entities).
Furthermore, an assigned ID is never reused, even if a handle is dropped. The
kernel keeps a user-reference count for each handle. Every time a handle is
exposed to a peer, the user-reference count of that handle is incremented by
one. This is never done asynchronously, but only synchronously when an ioctl is
called by the holding peer. Therefore, a peer can reliable deduce the current
user-reference count of all its handles, regardless of any ongoing message
transaction. References can be explicitly dropped by a peer. Once the counter of
a handle hits zero, it is destroyed, its ID becomes invalid, and will not be
reused again. Note that a peer can never have multiple different handles to the
same node, rather the kernel always coalesces them into a single handle, using
the user-reference counter to track it. However, if a handle is fully released,
but the peer later acquires a handle to the same node again, its ID will be
different, as IDs are never reused. A concept of soft-references is not
supported.
      </p><p>
When allocating a new node, the node owner implicitly also gets a handle to that
node. As long as the node is valid, the kernel will pin a single user-reference
to the owner's handle. This guarantees that a node owner always retains access
to their node, until they explicitly destroy it (which will also implicitly
release that pinned user-reference on the handle). Otherwise, a handle to a
local node behaves just like any other handle, that is, user-references are
acquired and released according to its use. However, whenever the overall sum of
all user-references on all handles to a node drops to 1 (which implies that only
the pinned reference of the owner is left), a notification is queued on the node
owner. If the counter is incremented again, any such notification is dropped, if
not already dequeued.

This command resets a peer context to its initial state. It takes a 64-bit flags

destroyed atomically, followed by a release of all held handles. Lastly, all

The remaining cleanup is not. This means, if another command is executed in

Any node marked as persistent, as well as the seed message, are preserved and
