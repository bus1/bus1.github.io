      A bus1 message is used to send data or notifications between peers. A data
      message consists of payload of a logical byte stream of arbitrary size,
      potentially along with handles and file descriptors. No restriction is
      placed on the format of the payload.
    </p></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="id-1.5"></a><h2>Message order</h2><p>
      Messages are globally ordered to ensure that the order of received
      messages are consistent between peers and that causality is respected.
      Consistency means that any two peers that receive any pair of the same two
      messages are guaranteed to receive them in the same order. Causality
      means that any message is ordered after any event that may have caused the
      message to be sent. E.g., if one message is sent before another, they are
      ordered accordingly, or if one message is received before another is sent
      they are also ordered accordingly.
    </p><p>
      Note, however, that whilst a message order is guaranteed, messages are not
      delivered instantaneously. I.e., there is no guarantee that a message can
      be received the moment it has been sent. That said, the time between send
      and receive is guaranteed to be finite and in practice will be very brief.
    </p></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="id-1.6"></a><h2>Metadata</h2><p>
      The kernel amends all data messages with the <code class="varname">uid</code>,
      <code class="varname">gid</code>, <code class="varname">pid</code>, and <code class="varname">tid</code>
      of the sending peer. The information is collected from the sending peer
      when the message is sent and translated into the namespaces of the
      receiving peer (which was pinned when the peer was initialized).
    </p></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="id-1.7"></a><h2>Quotas</h2><p>
      Any resources used by in-flight messages are subject to per-user quotas,
      accounted on the sending user. The number of in-flight file descriptors
      are subject to a global per-user quota, irrespective of the destination,
      but the other quotas apply per pair of sending user and destination peer.
    </p><p>
      In-flight file descriptors are limited in the same way as they are for
      UDS, though the accounting is distinct: A user is allowed the same number
      of in-flight file descriptors as it is allowed open file descriptors.
    </p><p>
      The total number of in-flight messages as well as in-flight handles
      destined to a given peer are both limited by constants. The total amount
      of available pool-space for in-flight messages is simply the amount of
      pool-space not used by received messages.
    </p><p>
      For both messages, handles and pool-size the amount of the resource a
      given user may consume is taken to be half of what is not used by anyone
      else. By way of example, if the receiveng peer has a pool-size of 1024kB,
      and 128kB is currently used by messages that are already received, and
      four users have used 128kB each, that means that from the point of view
      of each of the users the ammount of pool-space not used by anyone else is
      512kB so they are allowed to consume up to 256kB, or in other words they
      have 128kB left of their quota. Note however, that the moment a user uses
      more of the pool the computation changes, so whilst the next user to send
      a message is guaranteed to be allowed to send a 128kB message, it is not
      the case that each user is guaranteed the same (in this example that would
      require more space than the pool has available).
    </p></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="id-1.8"></a><h2>Sending messages</h2><p>
      Messages are passed to the kernel with the
      <code class="constant">BUS1_CMD_SEND</code> ioctl. The kernel delivers the message
      to the owners of the nodes referenced by the destination handles. Sending
      messages without holding a handle to a node owned by the destination peer
      is not possible. The payload of messages are queued in the pool of the
      destination peer (see above).
    </p><p>
      The <code class="constant">BUS1_CMD_SEND</code> ioctl uses a

      are available to be recevied, <code class="constant">POLLIN</code> is reported.
      However, if only silent messages are queued the peer is not woken up. For
      compatibility reasons, <code class="constant">POLLOUT</code> is always reported as
